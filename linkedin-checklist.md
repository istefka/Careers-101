## Must-Have Sections

### Custom URL
- [ ] A custom URL is more memorable, professional, and easier to share.  
  **Tip:** Personalize your URL to include your name clearly. Avoid numbers and symbols.

---

### Header
- [ ] **Profile photo:** Upload a recent, professional-looking, and close-up photo. It doesn’t need to be a professional headshot; you can use a cell phone! Wear something you might wear to work in front of a non-distracting background.
- [ ] **Headline:** Use a concise job title you’re seeking (up to 10 words). Optionally, you can add:
  - Industry
  - Certifications
  - Key skills/tools
  - Aspirations
- [ ] **Background Photo:** Think about what image represents you, your brand, and/or your professional interests. It shouldn’t be blurry and directly related to the field of a job you are looking for.

---

## About
- [ ] **Professional Bio/About Section:** Showcase some personality while talking about your experience and what you hope to do next. Include who you are, what you do, and what you are interested in doing, and key skills you developed.
- [ ] **Featured Section:** Showcase your experience and projects by providing evidence. Add external links like your GitHub profile link and/or blogs that you might have written about your journey on external platforms like Medium, etc.

## Activity

## Connections
- [ ] Aim for **300+ LinkedIn connections** for your profile to be accepted; however, the algorithm works best when you reach 500 connections. Continue expanding your network!

---

## Experience
- [ ] **Previous Roles:** Include all your positions. Consider all the roles you’ve held including in past and current jobs (unpaid and paid), extracurricular opportunities.
- [ ] **Description:** Include details about your experiences in paragraph and bullet-point form to give readers a clear understanding of your role in each position. You can copy this information from your resume. Aim to quantify at least 50% of your achievements to provide concrete evidence of your impact.
- [ ] **Career Breaks:** 66% of employees said they acquired new skills or improved existing ones while taking a career break. Accordingly, giving employers context for your career break eliminates any assumptions or biases they may have about your hiatus from work.
- [ ] **Masterschool:** Ensure your Masterschool program is listed in the Education section, not the Experience section.

---

## Education
- [ ] **Schools:** Show off your education. Include your college information and don’t be shy about including clubs you were a part of.
- [ ] **Masterschool:** Add your Masterschool program including a description of the program and a list of skills you have learned in bullet points.
- [ ] **Projects:** Include any projects from Masterschool. If you worked on a project on a team or led a personal project include them here with a description of what you did and how you did it.

## Skills
- [ ] **Relevant Keywords:** Include keywords and phrases that recruiters in your field would search for. You can find by looking at the profiles of people in positions or fields you may be interested in—or in job descriptions posted in roles or industries of interest.

## Engagement Enhancements
- [ ] **Groups:** Follow groups and influencers that align with your personal and professional interests. Be sure to check out groups affiliated with previous schools you have attended or groups in your intended industry.
- [ ] **Companies:** Follow companies/organizations that you are interested in and that are leaders in your field. Following relevant organizations is a great way to stay current with company news, learn more about a company, and hear about internships and job opportunities. Additionally, sometimes recruiters first review potential candidates already following their company on LinkedIn.
